description: "This time in our tutorial userspace TCP/IP stack we will implement a minimum viable IP layer and test it with ICMP echo requests. We will take a look at the headers of IPv4 and ICMPv4 and describe how to check them for integrity. Some features, such as IP fragmentation, are left as an exercise for the reader."
