Welcome to my blog.

My name is Sami and I work as a software developer. I'm starting a blog about computers and programming (sheesh, like there are not enough of them!).

I believe, however, that documenting the things I learn and expressing them concisely as possible is beneficial for overall understanding of topics. Hopefully, you'll get something out of the (future) posts. And I'm always happy to receive feedback too! 

Despite how estimates are never accurate, I'll 'promise' to blog at least once a month. Here I come!
